# Protected Routes Issues and Fixes

## Issues Identified:
1. **Login redirect issue**: After successful login, redirects to "/" instead of protected route
2. **Incorrect navigation in search**: Uses `/anime/${id}` instead of correct route `/(tabs)/home/${id}`
3. **Syntax error in Login component**: Console.log in JSX
4. **Incorrect labels in Login form**: Says "Name" instead of "Email" and "Password"
5. **Missing route structure**: Need to ensure proper nesting of protected routes

## Fixes Applied:
- [x] Fix Login component redirect after authentication (changed to "/(tabs)")
- [ ] Fix navigation path in search component
- [x] Remove syntax error in Login component
- [x] Correct form labels in Login component
- [ ] Verify protected route structure is working
- [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end
